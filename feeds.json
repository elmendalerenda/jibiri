SS7, as the protocol is known, makes it possible for a person in one country to send text messages to someone in another country. It also allows phone calls to go uninterrupted when the caller is traveling on a train.</p>\n<p>The same functionality can be used to eavesdrop on conversations, track geographic whereabouts, or intercept text messages.
